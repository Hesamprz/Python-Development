# Week 6

## Fraction
This project implements a `Fraction` class in Python, allowing basic arithmetic operations on fractions while maintaining simplicity and clarity. It is designed with object-oriented principles for enhanced modularity and reusability.

## Store Management Project (oop)
This project is a simple JSON-based database system built using object-oriented programming that allows creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in a JSON file. All database operations are encapsulated within the Database class, where data is stored in a list and automatically persisted to the JSON file after any modification. Simply run the main file to see it in action.
